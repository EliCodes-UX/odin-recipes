            <li>Step 1. Make the breading. in a zip-loc bag mix your flour, paprika, salt, and pepper until well
                combined</li>
            <li>Step 2. Dredge the chicken. Pour the buttermilk into a bowl, then dip your chicken into the buttermilk
                until its <b>COMPLETLY</b> soaked. After all the chicken is soaked in buttermilk place your chicken
                inside of the zip-loc bag and shake well.</li>
            <li>Step 3. Next we transfer your chicken on a baking sheet and allow your coating to become a paste-like
                consistency.</li>
            <li>Step 4. Now we gotta fry it like you were fried that one time you wore those beat shoes to homecoming.
                Do this by pouring your oil in a skillet and turn it up to high. place chicken in the oil until it turns
                brown, keep an eye on it because after it browns, reduce the heat, cover the skillet and cook for about
                30 mins, and once your timer goes off remove the cover and turn that boy back to high and fry until
                <b>EXTRA</b>crispy
